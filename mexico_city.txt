Mexico City is the capital city of Mexico. Mexico City is very well known for being the longest continuously inhabited city in the Western Hemisphere, and it is also the largest. The population of Mexico City is growing very quickly. At a population of 21 million people, about one-fifth of the country's inhabitants, it is one of the most greatly populated cities in the world, and it is the worlds largest capital city. These circumstances force much of the population to live and deal with poverty, pollution, poor housing, inadequate sanitation, and uncertain water supplies.
             Mexico City is located in the south central part of the country. Over 95% of the population speaks Spanish, which is the official language. There is no official religion in Mexico City, but 92% of the population practices Roman Catholicism. Mexico City leads the nation in decision-making for the universities, magazines, newspapers, museums, and performing arts centers since the majority of these places are located within the capital.
             There is a major condition separating the city: wealth. The capital city has districts social distinctions. One can travel for miles in the rich southern and western parts of the city without becoming aware that they are in an underdeveloped nation. There is a sharp contrast when one travels to the poorer areas located towards the center of Mexico City. They will find that housing is limited, access to utilities and services is limited. In these areas, the standard of living is well below the poverty level.
             The former name of Mexico City is Tenochtitlan, the Aztec capital city. It was built on a one-square mile island in an enormous shallow lake. In the early 1500's Tenochtitlan was a very large city in the world. It was a crowded metropolitan area with broad streets, and grand temples and buildings. Tenochtitlan was even more advanced than Venice, its equivalent.
